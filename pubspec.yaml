# Setup xcode flavor flutter_launcher_icons
## Then open up the iOS subproject in Xcode and open 
## Runner.xcodeproj > Build Settings > Search for "Primary App Icon Set Name". 
## In there, update all the values for each flavor to AppIcon-flavorname 
## (looks like AppIcon-criocabin and AppIcon-evco for the flavors above). 
## Then open up the Runner target in that same file and repeat those same steps in there.

# Setup xcode flavor flutter_native_splash
## Create LaunchScreen<FlavorName>.storyboard for each flavor
## Copy and replace all flavor storyboard files in Base.lproj -> created storyboard files
